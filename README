The main function is in EquilibriumLJ.java
Please download every .java file here to use the program.

To compile, use the command

$ javac EquilibriumLJ.java

then command run:

$ java EquilibriumLJ 0.65 0.56 0 100 6.0

where 0.65 is the number density rho=N/V and 0.56 is the temperature T*=1/kT. 
0 and 100 are the start and end file labels, there will be 100 configs generated.
6.0 is the cutoff radius of LJ potential.
Please run according to the rho and T* and number of configs you like.

A directory named like "rho65t56" will be created if it doesn't exist already. 
where 65 and 56 are 100*rho and 100*T (rounded to nearest integer), respectively.
The output configs will be in the folder created, named "file0", "file1", etc. There will be 100 files for the example above.
On the screen (or in an .out file) will be shown the average energy at each particle for each config generated.
If the energies shown are in a dropping trend, the system is not well equilibrated. 
In this case please increase the value of "sweeps" in EquilibriumLJ.java

IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE PROGRAM
r0 and epsilon in the LJ potential in our program are set to be 1.
The unit cell side length should be at least twice the LJ cutoff distance, because we are using minimal image.
