The main function is in EquilibriumLJ.java
Please download every .java file here to use the program.

To compile, use the command

$ javac EquilibriumLJ.java

then command run:

$ java EquilibriumLJ 0.65 0.56 

where 0.65 is the number density rho=N/V and 0.56 is the temperature T*=1/kT. 
Please run according to the rho and T* you like.

For the code to run successfully, please create a directory before running named like "rho65t56". 
where 65 and 56 are 100*rho and 100*T, respectively.
The output configs will be in the folder created, named "file0", "file1", etc. There will be 100 files.
On the screen (or in an .out file) will be shown the average energy at each particle for each config generated.
If the energies shown are dropping, the system is not well equilibrated. 
In this case please increase the value of "sweeps" in EquilibriumLJ.java

IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE PROGRAM
r0 and epsilon in the LJ potential in our program are set to be 1.
The unit cell side length should be at least twice the LJ cutoff distance, because we are using minimal image.
